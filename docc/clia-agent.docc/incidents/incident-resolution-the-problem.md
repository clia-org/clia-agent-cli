Incidents ripple across tools and repos. During response, humans and bots need
to coordinate quickly with clear guardrails: what’s affected, what’s blocked,
and where to look next. When these signals are scattered—ad‑hoc Markdown,
inconsistent JSON, or missing links—teams lose time and context.

Goals:

- Single source of truth for the active incident banner.
- Human‑friendly, deterministic JSON formatting to avoid noisy diffs.
- First‑class fields for blocked tools and useful links.
- Simple CLI ergonomics to script and automate response flows.
