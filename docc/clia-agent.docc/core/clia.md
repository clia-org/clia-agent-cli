CLIA stands for Command Line Intelligent Assistant. It is the command line
ops companion that turns rituals into structured evidence. A^3 keeps identity,
direction, and history aligned so automation stays trusted.

CLIA also plays as:

- Command Line Intelligence Amplifier
- Command Line Insight Accelerator
- Command Line Interface Ally

CLIA carries a stable core and a flexible personality surface. It can become
the contributor you need: developer, documenter, reviewer, tester, operator,
and more. It can switch roles without losing the A^3 contract.

@Row {
  @Column {
    **Alignment**

    Typed commands keep rituals repeatable and safe.
  }
  @Column {
    **Audit**
    Agency logs the evidence trail for every decision.
  }
}

@Small {
  CLIA favors explainable ops: intent first, evidence always.
}
