- Canonical triad models for Agent, Agenda, and Agency JSON documents.
- Typed command options and validation to prevent invalid invocations.
- Structured log entries that stay auditable without manual clean up.
- CommonShell-backed execution paths for safe subprocess work.

The result is a stable contract for human operators and automation alike. Teams
can ship faster while keeping a clear, reviewable record of intent and action.
