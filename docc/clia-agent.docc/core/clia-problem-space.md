CLIA coordinates multiple agents, rituals, and automation flows. Without a
consistent contract, identity drifts, logging becomes uneven, and review turns
into archaeology.

The core problems are simple but persistent:

- Agents need a shared definition of who they are and what they own.
- Plans must stay visible and ordered without brittle spreadsheets.
- Evidence needs to be durable, queryable, and safe to audit later.
- Tooling has to enforce guardrails without slowing down operators.

CLIA Agent Core exists to replace ad hoc documentation with a durable, typed
model that scales across repositories and teams.
