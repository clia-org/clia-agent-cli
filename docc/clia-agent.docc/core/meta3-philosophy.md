META^3 is the layer that keeps A^3 truthful. It applies mission, execution,
telemetry, and accountability across Agent, Agenda, and Agency so the system
stays aligned as it scales.

## Mission

Define why the agent exists, the principles that shape its decisions, and the
boundaries it will not cross.

## Execution

Translate intent into rituals, commands, and operating procedures that are
repeatable and safe.

## Telemetry

Capture structured signals that let operators see drift early without digging
through logs.

## Accountability

Audit the evidence trail. When the system makes a change, the who, when, and
why must be easy to reconstruct.

## META^3 in Practice

| META | Agent | Agenda | Agency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mission | Purpose + guardrails | Initiative intent | Summary context |
| Execution | Ritual definitions | Milestone cadence | Logged actions |
| Telemetry | Metrics + tags | Risk tracking | Evidence + links |
| Accountability | Review checkpoints | Due dates | Timestamped proofs |

> Note: META^3 reinforces A^3. It does not replace the triads; it makes them
> resilient under pressure.
