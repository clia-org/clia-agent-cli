A^3 is CLIA's contract: every agent carries a mission (Agent), a direction
(Agenda), and a record (Agency). The three together provide alignment,
autonomy, and auditability.

## Agent

The Agent defines identity and intent: purpose, responsibilities, guardrails,
links, and operating context. It answers who the agent is and how it should act.

## Agenda

The Agenda defines direction: goals, milestones, horizons, and backlog. It
answers where the agent is going and what matters next.

## Agency

The Agency defines evidence: timestamped log entries with summaries, tags, and
links. It answers what happened and why it matters.

> Important: JSON triads are the source of truth. Markdown mirrors are optional
> and should never drift from the JSON.

## Why A^3 Wins

A^3 keeps automation aligned and reviewable. When rituals update the triads and
commands are built from typed options, the system stays explainable even as the
surface area grows.

## META^3 Overlay

META^3 is the operating layer that keeps A^3 honest. It applies mission,
execution, telemetry, and accountability to each triad so humans and automation
stay aligned.
