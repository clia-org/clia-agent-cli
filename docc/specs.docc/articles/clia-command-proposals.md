# Feature Specification: CLIA Command Proposals

**Feature Branch**: `[clia-command-proposals]`  
**Created**: 2026-01-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "CLIA should propose commands instead of manual !"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(Mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Generable Command Proposals (Priority: P1)

As an operator, I want CLIA responses to include proposed commands using `@Generable` so I can
approve or edit them without typing `!`.

**Why this priority**: This is the core behavior change and unblocks automated command proposals.

**Independent Test**: Ask for a task that needs a shell command and verify the response includes
`proposedCommands` generated by the `@Generable` schema.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a task that needs shell execution, **When** CLIA responds,
   **Then** the response includes one or more proposed commands shaped by the `@Generable` schema.
2. **Given** a proposed command, **When** the user approves it,
   **Then** the command executes via CommonProcess streaming.

### User Story 2 - Schema-constrained Responses (Priority: P2)

As an implementer, I want the response schema to be generated via `@Generable` so the model only
emits the expected command proposal fields.

**Why this priority**: Ensures predictable model output and schema alignment.

**Independent Test**: Build the response model and confirm the generated schema includes
`proposedCommands` and its nested fields.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the response model annotated with `@Generable`, **When** the schema is generated,
   **Then** `proposedCommands` is present and typed.
2. **Given** the schema, **When** the model responds, **Then** the output conforms without
   fallback parsing or ad-hoc extraction.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when no command is needed?
- How does the system handle invalid or unsafe proposed commands?
- How does the system represent multiple proposed commands in a single response?
- How does the system handle a malformed or partial `@Generable` payload?

## Requirements *(Mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Response model MUST include a `proposedCommands` field when commands are suggested.
- **FR-002**: `proposedCommands` MUST be represented in the `@Generable` schema output.
- **FR-003**: Each proposed command MUST include the command string and a rationale.
- **FR-004**: Each proposed command MUST indicate whether approval is required.
- **FR-005**: Responses with no commands MUST omit or empty `proposedCommands`.
- **FR-006**: The model MUST be instructed to emit only schema-conforming `@Generable` output.

### Key Entities *(Include If Feature Involves Data)*

- **ProposedCommand**: command string, arguments, rationale, approvalRequired, optional risk or
  policy tags.

#### ProposedCommand Shape (Draft)

```json
{
  "command": "rg",
  "arguments": ["-n", "sosumi", "."],
  "rationale": "Find references to the sosumi tool in the mono workspace.",
  "approvalRequired": true,
  "policyTags": ["shell", "read-only"]
}
```

#### Generable Response Shape (Draft)

```json
{
  "responseText": "I can scan the repo for sosumi references. Want me to run it?",
  "proposedCommands": [
    {
      "command": "rg",
      "arguments": ["-n", "sosumi", "."],
      "rationale": "Find references to the sosumi tool in the mono workspace.",
      "approvalRequired": true,
      "policyTags": ["shell", "read-only"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Success Criteria *(Mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of command suggestions are represented in `proposedCommands`.
- **SC-002**: Schema generation includes `proposedCommands` without manual patching.
